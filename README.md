**Viewing Gradient Flow as Reverse Diffusion: A Thermodynamic and Probabilistic Perspective**

## Abstract

Gradient descent can be viewed as a reverse-time probability flow ODE â€” a deterministic interpretation of score-based diffusion. This theoretical lens connects optimization with stochastic generative modeling, grounded in the thermodynamics of learning and Wasserstein flows.
