Title: Viewing Gradient Flow as Reverse Diffusion: A Thermodynamic and Probabilistic Perspective
Authors: Anonymous Author(s)
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization lies at the core of modern machine learning. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on gradient descent dynamics by interpreting them as reverse-time probability flows akin to those used in diffusion-based generative models.
