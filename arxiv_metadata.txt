Title: Viewing Gradient Flow as Reverse Diffusion: A Thermodynamic and Probabilistic Perspective
Authors: Anonymous Author(s)
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization lies at the core of modern machine learning. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on gradient descent dynamics by interpreting them as reverse-time probability flows akin to those used in diffusion-based generative models. Drawing connections between Wasserstein gradient flows, Fokker-Planck equations, and score-based diffusion models, we propose that gradient descent trajectories in parameter space can be understood as the deterministic reversal of an underly...
